# Component: Productivity Integration

## Purpose
The **Productivity Integration** component combines project management tools with astrological timing recommendations, enabling users to align tasks and workstreams with favorable planetary influences.

## Functionality
- Manage tasks, projects, and deadlines in a centralized interface.
- Sync with external tools (e.g., Google Calendar, Asana).
- Overlay astrological events (e.g., New Moon, retrogrades) on calendars.
- Provide recommendations for optimal task timing based on transits and natal chart interactions.

## Implementation Details
- **Task Management**:
  - Create, edit, and assign tasks with deadlines, similar to Trello/Asana.
  - Categorize tasks by type (e.g., creative, analytical, collaborative).
- **Calendar Integration**:
  - Sync with Google Calendar, Microsoft Outlook, or Asana via APIs.
  - Display project deadlines alongside astrological events (e.g., Full Moon, Mercury retrograde).
- **Astrological Timing**:
  - Use a rules-based engine to map planetary positions to task recommendations:
    - **New Moon**: Start new projects or set goals.
    - **Full Moon**: Complete tasks or launch publicly.
    - **Mercury Retrograde**: Focus on revisions, avoid new contracts.
    - **Venus/Mars**: Prioritize collaboration or action-oriented tasks.
  - Personalize based on natal chart (e.g., Jupiter in 10th house for career tasks).
  - Highlight void-of-course Moon periods to avoid initiating tasks.
- **Notifications**:
  - Alert users to favorable transits (e.g., “Tomorrow’s Jupiter trine supports expansion”).
  - Remind users of deadlines aligned with astrological events.

## Integration
- Consume Ephemeris Data Fetcher for planetary positions.
- Use Astrological Insights Dashboard for transit-natal aspect data.
- Expose API endpoints for task syncing (e.g., `/api/tasks/sync?tool=google_calendar`).

## Example
For July 24, 2025, with Moon in Cancer:
- Task: “Finalize project proposal.”
- Recommendation: “Schedule for tomorrow’s New Moon in Leo for a strong start.”
- Calendar: Overlay New Moon on July 25, 2025, with task deadline.

## Challenges
- **API Limits**: Handle rate limits for third-party integrations (e.g., Google Calendar).
- **Relevance**: Balance astrological advice with practical usability to avoid overwhelming users.
- **Syncing**: Ensure real-time updates across external tools and the hub.
