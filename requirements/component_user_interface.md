# Component: User Interface

## Purpose
The **User Interface (UI)** provides an intuitive, visually appealing experience for users to interact with the Starboard Mission Control Hub, combining astrological visualizations, productivity tools, and personalized settings.

## Functionality
- Display the Astrological Insights Dashboard (zodiac wheel, bi-wheel, graphical ephemeris).
- Provide task management and calendar views for productivity.
- Support user onboarding, customization, and notifications.
- Ensure accessibility for non-astrologers and mobile responsiveness.

## Implementation Details
- **Framework**: Use **React** or **Vue.js** for dynamic rendering, with **Tailwind CSS** for styling.
- **Visualizations**:
  - **Zodiac Wheel**: Circular layout with planets plotted by sign and degree (D3.js).
  - **Bi-Wheel Chart**: Inner (natal) and outer (transits) wheels for comparison.
  - **Graphical Ephemeris**: Timeline of planetary movements with retrograde markers.
  - **Task Dashboard**: Grid or Kanban board for tasks, synced with calendars.
- **Onboarding**:
  - Prompt for birth data (date, time, location) and current location.
  - Offer a tutorial on reading charts and using the hub.
- **Customization**:
  - Toggle tropical/sidereal zodiac, house systems (Placidus, Whole Sign).
  - Select tracked bodies (e.g., planets, asteroids, Uranian points).
  - Adjust notification preferences (e.g., daily transit alerts).
- **Accessibility**:
  - Use ARIA labels for screen readers.
  - Ensure high-contrast visuals and mobile responsiveness.
- **Notifications**:
  - Display in-app alerts for astrological events or task deadlines.
  - Support push notifications for mobile apps.

## Integration
- Connect to Ephemeris Data Fetcher for planetary positions.
- Render Astrological Insights Dashboard visualizations.
- Sync with Productivity Integration for task and calendar displays.
- Use geolocation APIs for location-based adjustments.

## Example
- **Home Screen**: Shows zodiac wheel with Sun in Leo 2°, Moon in Cancer, and task list.
- **Interaction**: Click a planet to view its transit interpretation (e.g., “Mars in Aries: Bold action”).
- **Calendar View**: Displays tasks with New Moon marker on July 25, 2025.

## Challenges
- **Usability**: Simplify astrological terms for beginners with tooltips and guides.
- **Performance**: Optimize rendering of complex charts on low-end devices.
- **Consistency**: Ensure UI consistency across web and mobile platforms.
