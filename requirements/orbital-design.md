# Orbital Design: Graph-Based Visualization for Starboard Mission Control Hub

## Purpose
The **Orbital Design** component implements a graph-based visualization algorithm to represent the Starboard Mission Control Hub’s core entities—key locations, workstreams, and agentic node points—as interconnected nodes in a dynamic, orbital structure. This design enables flexible Model Context Protocol (MCP) routing for real-time data integration and streamlined workstream tracking, aligning with the hub’s vision of unifying astrological insights and productivity in a mobile-ready, interactive interface.

## Vision
The Orbital Design visualizes the hub’s ecosystem as a network of nodes orbiting around central hubs, resembling a celestial system:
- **Central Nodes**: Represent key locations (e.g., user’s geographic position or astrological houses), workstreams (e.g., projects, task groups), and agentic node points (e.g., AI-driven decision points or MCP-driven actions).
- **Edges**: Indicate relationships, such as task dependencies, astrological influences (e.g., transits affecting a workstream), or MCP data flows.
- **Dynamic Flexibility**: Allows users to manipulate nodes via hold-and-drag, tap-to-focus, or hotkeys, optimizing workflows and tracking progress in real-time.
- **MCP Integration**: Routes data and actions through MCP-compliant servers, enabling autonomous agentic interactions (e.g., fetching ephemeris data, syncing tasks).
- **Workstream Tracking**: Monitors task progress and deadlines within the graph, with astrological metadata enhancing decision-making (e.g., prioritizing tasks during favorable transits).

## Functionality
- **Graph-Based Visualization**:
  - Render a network of nodes and edges using **D3.js** (for dynamic SVG visuals) or **Cytoscape.js** (for complex graph interactions).
  - Central nodes include:
    - **Locations**: User’s geolocation (e.g., New York, 40.7128°N, 74.0060°W) or astrological houses (e.g., 10th house for career).
    - **Workstreams**: Projects or task groups (e.g., “Marketing Campaign,” “Product Launch”).
    - **Agentic Node Points**: AI-driven actions (e.g., “Suggest task priority based on New Moon”) or MCP-driven data fetches (e.g., ephemeris updates).
  - Edges represent dependencies, astrological influences, or data flows (e.g., task A precedes task B; Sun in Leo boosts creative tasks).
- **Interactive Controls**:
  - **Hold-and-Drag**: Reorder nodes to optimize workflows (e.g., drag a task node to a new workstream).
  - **Pinch-to-Zoom/Swipe**: Explore graph on mobile devices (e.g., zoom into a project’s task nodes).
  - **Hotkeys**: Quick actions (e.g., `Ctrl+W` to create workstream, `Ctrl+A` to add agentic node).
  - **Custom Buttons**: User-defined buttons for frequent actions (e.g., “Fetch Transit,” “Track Progress”).
- **MCP Routing**:
  - Use MCP client to connect to external servers (e.g., Swiss Ephemeris, Google Calendar) for real-time data.
  - Enable agentic nodes to autonomously fetch data or trigger actions (e.g., query ephemeris for Moon phase, sync task deadlines).
  - Support dynamic routing via MCP’s HTTP/SSE transport for live updates.
- **Workstream Tracking**:
  - Track task progress, deadlines, and completion status within the graph.
  - Visualize astrological influences on nodes (e.g., color-code tasks green for favorable Jupiter transits).
  - Generate progress reports (e.g., “80% of Marketing Campaign tasks complete”).
- **Mobile Readiness**:
  - Optimize graph rendering for mobile with touch-friendly controls and compressed visuals.
  - Cache graph data (nodes, edges) for offline access using AsyncStorage (React Native) or Service Workers (web).

## Implementation Details
- **Visualization Tools**:
  - **D3.js**: Renders dynamic, SVG-based graphs with animated transitions for node movements and edge updates.
    - Example: Visualize a workstream as a central node orbited by task nodes, with edges showing dependencies.
    - Supports drag-to-reorder, pinch-to-zoom, and tap-to-focus.
  - **Cytoscape.js**: Handles complex graphs with large node/edge sets, using layouts like force-directed or circular for orbital aesthetics.
    - Example: Display agentic nodes (e.g., AI suggestions) orbiting a project node, with edges weighted by priority or astrological favorability.
    - Supports context menus (right-click/long-press) for node actions.
- **Node Structure**:
  - **Location Nodes**: Store geolocation (lat/lon) or astrological house data, linked to ephemeris calculations.
  - **Workstream Nodes**: Aggregate tasks/projects, with metadata (e.g., deadlines, priority).
  - **Agentic Nodes**: Represent AI-driven actions (e.g., “Suggest task for New Moon”) or MCP-driven data fetches (e.g., planetary positions).
- **Edge Structure**:
  - Define relationships (e.g., task A → task B for dependencies, workstream → location for context).
  - Weight edges by astrological influence (e.g., stronger edge for tasks during a Jupiter trine).
- **MCP Integration**:
  - Query MCP servers for ephemeris data (e.g., Sun in Leo ~2° on July 25, 2025) and productivity data (e.g., Google Calendar tasks).
  - Example: Agentic node triggers `fetch_planetary_positions` via MCP to tag tasks with transit data.
