# Component: Astrological Insights Dashboard

## Purpose
The **Astrological Insights Dashboard** visualizes real-time zodiacal positions, natal charts, transits, and aspects, providing users with actionable astrological insights tailored to their birth data and current location.

## Functionality
- Display an interactive bi-wheel chart (natal + transits).
- Show a graphical ephemeris for planetary movements over time.
- Present a zodiac wheel with real-time planetary positions.
- Highlight major aspects (conjunctions, trines, squares, etc.) and their interpretations.
- Provide personalized guidance based on transit-natal interactions.

## Implementation Details
- **Data Input**:
  - Retrieve planetary positions from the Ephemeris Data Fetcher.
  - Require user’s birth data (date, time, location) for natal chart generation.
  - Use current location (via geolocation or manual input) for transit adjustments.
- **Visualizations**:
  - **Bi-Wheel Chart**: Inner wheel (natal chart), outer wheel (transits) using D3.js or Chart.js.
  - **Graphical Ephemeris**: Plot planetary longitudes over time (e.g., daily/monthly), marking retrogrades and sign changes.
  - **Zodiac Wheel**: Circular layout showing planets in signs (e.g., Sun in Leo 2°), with degrees and minutes.
  - **Aspectarian**: Table or grid of aspects (e.g., Sun trine Jupiter) with interpretations.
- **Interpretations**:
  - Rules-based engine for insights, e.g., “Mars in Aries conjunct natal Sun: Take bold action.”
  - Highlight key events: lunar phases, void-of-course Moon, retrogrades, ingresses.
  - Personalize based on natal house placements (e.g., 10th house for career).
- **Customization**:
  - Support tropical/sidereal zodiacs and house systems (Placidus, Whole Sign, etc.).
  - Allow users to select tracked bodies (e.g., planets, asteroids, Uranian points).

## Integration
- Consume Ephemeris Data Fetcher API for real-time positions.
- Feed insights to the Productivity Integration component for task recommendations.
- Use React/Vue.js for dynamic rendering and user interactions.

## Example
For a user with Sun in Virgo (natal) on July 24, 2025:
- Display: Transiting Sun in Leo 2°, trining natal Jupiter in Aries.
- Insight: “Favorable time for leadership and expansion in creative projects.”
- Visualize: Bi-wheel showing transiting Sun in 11th house, natal Sun in 2nd house.

## Challenges
- **Complexity**: Simplify astrological data for non-expert users with tooltips and tutorials.
- **Performance**: Optimize rendering of complex charts (e.g., bi-wheels) for mobile devices.
- **Accuracy**: Ensure aspect calculations (e.g., orb of 8° for conjunctions) are precise.
