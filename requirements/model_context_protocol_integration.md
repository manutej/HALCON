# Component: Model Context Protocol (MCP) Integration

## Purpose
The **Model Context Protocol (MCP) Integration** component enables the Starboard Mission Control Hub to seamlessly connect with external data sources and tools using the Model Context Protocol (MCP), an open standard developed by Anthropic. By integrating MCP, the hub enhances its ability to fetch real-time astrological ephemeris data, sync with productivity platforms, and provide contextually relevant, personalized insights and recommendations for users.

## Functionality
- **Dynamic Data Integration**: Connect to external astrological databases (e.g., Swiss Ephemeris, Astro-Seek.com) and productivity tools (e.g., Google Calendar, Asana) via MCP-compliant servers.
- **Real-Time Contextual Insights**: Use MCP to enable the hub’s generative AI to access and process live data, such as planetary positions or user tasks, for accurate astrological and productivity recommendations.
- **Standardized Connectivity**: Replace custom API integrations with MCP’s universal protocol, reducing development overhead and improving scalability.
- **Personalized Workflows**: Leverage MCP to pull user-specific data (e.g., natal chart details, project deadlines) to tailor astrological guidance and task scheduling.

## Implementation Details
- **MCP Architecture**:
  - **Host**: The Starboard Mission Control Hub’s frontend (React/Vue.js) serves as the MCP host, interacting with users and coordinating with MCP clients.
  - **Client**: A serverless function (e.g., Netlify Edge Function) acts as the MCP client, managing communication between the hub and MCP servers.
  - **Servers**: External systems (e.g., Swiss Ephemeris, Google Calendar, Astro-Seek.com) expose data and tools via MCP-compliant interfaces.
- **Data Sources**:
  - **Astrological Data**: Connect to MCP servers for Swiss Ephemeris or Astro-Seek.com to fetch real-time zodiacal positions (e.g., Sun in Leo 2°, Moon in Cancer).
  - **Productivity Tools**: Integrate with MCP servers for Google Calendar, Asana, or Microsoft Outlook to sync tasks, deadlines, and events.
  - **User Data**: Access user-specific data (e.g., natal chart, preferences) stored in an encrypted database (e.g., MongoDB) via an MCP server.
- **MCP Features**:
  - **Tool Access**: Enable the hub’s AI to call functions like `fetch_planetary_positions` or `sync_calendar_events` through MCP servers.
  - **Resource Access**: Retrieve structured data, such as ephemeris tables or task lists, for real-time analysis.
  - **Prompt Templates**: Use pre-defined prompts (e.g., “Generate astrological insights for Mars in Aries”) to guide AI responses.
- **Transport Mechanisms**:
  - Support **stdio servers** for local ephemeris calculations (e.g., Moshier Ephemeris).
  - Use **HTTP over SSE** for remote access to astrological APIs or productivity tools.
  - Implement **streamable HTTP servers** for dynamic, real-time data streaming.
- **Security**:
  - Implement OAuth 2.0 for secure authentication with MCP servers, as recommended by WorkOS.
  - Encrypt sensitive data (e.g., natal chart details, task data) using AES-256.
  - Validate MCP server responses to prevent unauthorized data access or execution, addressing security concerns from the MCP specification.

## Integration
- **With Ephemeris Data Fetcher**:
  - Use MCP to connect to Swiss Ephemeris or Astro-Seek.com servers for real-time planetary positions.
  - Example: Call `fetch_planetary_positions(date=2025-07-24, time=16:29, lat=40.7128, lon=-74.0060)` to retrieve Sun, Moon, and planet positions.
- **With Astrological Insights Dashboard**:
  - Feed MCP-retrieved planetary data to the dashboard for visualization (e.g., zodiac wheel, bi-wheel chart).
  - Use MCP prompt templates to generate insights (e.g., “Mars conjunct natal Sun: Prioritize bold actions”).
- **With Productivity Integration**:
  - Sync tasks and deadlines with Google Calendar or Asana via MCP servers.
  - Overlay astrological events (e.g., New Moon on July 25, 2025) on task calendars using MCP resource access.
- **With User Interface**:
  - Display MCP-driven insights and synced tasks in the UI, ensuring seamless rendering of real-time data.
  - Provide user feedback on MCP server status (e.g., “Connected to Astro-Seek.com for ephemeris data”).

## Example Workflow
For a user on July 24, 2025, 4:29 PM PDT, New York:
1. **MCP Data Fetch**:
   - The MCP client queries an Astro-Seek.com MCP server for planetary positions (e.g., Sun in Leo ~2°, Moon in Cancer).
   - Adjusts for PDT (UTC-7) and geolocation (40.7128°N, 74.0060°W).
2. **Insight Generation**:
   - The hub’s AI uses a prompt template via MCP to generate: “Moon in Cancer trine natal Jupiter: Focus on nurturing team collaborations.”
3. **Productivity Sync**:
   - MCP client pulls tasks from Google Calendar (e.g., “Finalize project proposal”).
   - Recommends scheduling for July 25, 2025, during the New Moon in Leo, fetched via an MCP server.
4. **UI Display**:
   - Renders a bi-wheel chart with transiting Moon in Cancer and natal Jupiter.
   - Shows task list with a notification: “Schedule proposal review tomorrow for optimal energy.”
