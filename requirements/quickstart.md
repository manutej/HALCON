# Quickstart Guide: Starboard Mission Control Hub Documentation

## Welcome
This guide helps context engineering protocols or researchers navigate the **Starboard Mission Control Hub** documentation. The hub is a platform that combines all your work (tasks, projects) with astrology insights to help you work smarter, using a cool “map” (graph) to show how tasks connect, and easy controls on your phone or computer. Follow this order to understand the hub’s vision, design, and parts.

## Why Read This Way?
We start with a simple explanation, then dive into the big picture, system design, and specific pieces. This helps you see how the hub brings together workstreams, star-based advice, and smart connections (using a tool called MCP) in one place.

## Reading Order
Here’s the best way to read the documents:

1. **eli5.md** (5 minutes)  
   - *What it covers*: A super-simple overview of the hub, like explaining it to a kid. It tells you why the hub is awesome (one place for all work, star tips, easy controls) and what it does (shows tasks on a map, suggests best times).
   - *Why start here?*: It gives you the big idea without techy words, so you know what the hub is about.
   - *Key takeaway*: The hub is your go-to for work and astrology, with a map-like view and phone-friendly controls.

2. **Systemic_Vision.md** (10 minutes)  
   - *What it covers*: The full vision, explaining how the hub unifies your tasks and projects, uses astrology to pick the best times, and shows work as a connected map (called a graph). It also talks about custom buttons and smart data connections (MCP).
   - *Why next?*: It zooms in on goals and features, setting the stage for how the hub works.
   - *Key takeaway*: The hub is a central place for work and star guidance, with a flexible map to optimize your tasks.

3. **Technical_Architecture.md** (15 minutes)  
   - *What it covers*: How the hub is built, like a blueprint. It explains the app (web and phone), backend (data processing), and tools for showing the task map (D3.js, Cytoscape.js). It also covers MCP for grabbing live data.
   - *Why third?*: It shows how the pieces fit together, so you understand the system before diving into details.
   - *Key takeaway*: The hub uses modern tech to make your work map fast, mobile-friendly, and connected to astrology and work apps.

4. **Orbital_Design.md** (10 minutes)  
   - *What it covers*: The special “map” (graph) that shows your tasks, projects, and locations as dots connected by lines. It explains how you can move dots around, and how smart points (agentic nodes) use MCP to fetch data or suggest actions.
   - *Why fourth?*: It dives into the cool graph system, building on the tech blueprint.
   - *Key takeaway*: The map makes work easy to track and adjust, with star-based tips and smart connections.

5. **Component_Ephemeris_Data_Fetcher.md** (10 minutes)  
   - *What it covers*: How the hub gets star data (like where the Sun or Moon is) to give you timing advice. It uses MCP to connect to astrology databases.
   - *Why fifth?*: Star data is a key part of the hub, but you need the big picture first.
   - *Key takeaway*: The hub grabs precise star positions to help you plan tasks at the right time.

6. **Component_User_Interface.md** (10 minutes)  
   - *What it covers*: The app’s look and feel, like how you tap, swipe, or drag to use it on your phone, or use shortcut keys on a computer. It shows your task map and star charts.
   - *Why last?*: It’s how you interact with the hub, so it’s easier to understand after the other pieces.
   - *Key takeaway*: The hub is easy and fun to use, with controls that work anywhere.

## Total Time
About 60 minutes to read all files, but you can stop after **eli5.md** or **Systemic_Vision.md** if you just want the basics.

## Tips
- **Skim first**: Check headings and examples to get the gist.
- **Focus on examples**: Look for scenarios (e.g., planning tasks on July 25, 2025) to see how the hub works.
- **Ask questions**: If something’s unclear, note it for the team to explain (e.g., what’s a “graph” or “MCP”?).
